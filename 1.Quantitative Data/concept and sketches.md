## Prevalence of undernourishment

The data brought me the question "How prevalent is undernourishment in the world?  Also, is there correlation between undernourishment and maternal and infant mortality rate?." I will use heatmap method on the world map to show the prevalence of undernourishment, and line chart for maternal and infant mortality rate.

## How much wastewater is generated by household in 2015

When I found the dataset of "Total wastewater generated", I was curious about How much water was wasted in the world. Then, I came up with the question, "how could I catch people's eye with a familiar subject?". I thought wastewater from households is the more familiar activity to many people compared to one from industries, Agriculture, forestry, and etc.

## Gap of accessibility for using safely managed drinking water services between rural and urban

In various areas, the gap between rural and urban is recognized. The dataset is also showing the gap of using safely managed drinking water services between rural and urban. But then, how could we visualize the data to show the gap to the public? I came up with the line chart to compare rural and urban areas of each country and has it been widening or narrowing?
