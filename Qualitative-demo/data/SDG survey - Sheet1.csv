Country Team,Briefly Explain
Similarly, the pandemic overburdened national authorities and created uncertainty over public spending due to the added pressure on national budgets and the disruption of the regular planning and budget execution. This led to a lower-than-expected level of involvement of national counterparts with JP activities. Furthermore, during March-September 2021, the JP was constrained by an ‘institutional slowdown’ caused by the April 2021 general elections and the interim period until the appointment of the new Government Cabinet. As such, the period was not conducive to discussing policy and structural changes. "
Armenia,"Due to the dual crises (COVID-19and hostilities in and around Nagorno Karabakh in 2020) the Government’s priorities for long-term development, as well as the JP’s operation have been impacted and the JP’s activities were delayed from July to December 2020. The JP team put many efforts to renew the dialogue with the GoA in the beginning of Y2021 to implement the activities in accordance with the Government’s priorities. In addition, due to snap parliamentary elections in June 2021 the JP encountered some delays since the key JP partners from the Government changed and thus, there was a need to rebuild new partnerships with both key stakeholder institutions - the DPM’s office and MoF. The JP has long discussions, meetings with the new Government for identifying possible ways to assist the new Government for the implementation of the Government’s new priorities and tasks in the scope of the project. "
Azerbaijan,"Two significant issues have a persistent effect on the project implementation, but with less severity: COVID-19 and the post-conflict situation in and around Nagorno-Karabakh. As the COVID effects continue to unfold, challenges affecting mobility and face-to-face meetings persist. 

Also, it is essential to mention additional external risks, such as the escalation of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, contributed to budgeting constraints and unavoidable burden on the Azerbaijan economy and shaped the new government priorities. These have also significantly affected the operation of the project and the engagement of the government partners. The PUNOs engage with high-level government representatives to move forward with the project activities to mitigate the adverse consequences."
Bangladesh,"Covid-19 pandemic resulted in two lockdowns- delaying updating process of DFA and FS and SDG Investor Mapping, as the government’s priorities had shifted towards responding to the pandemic.   This slowed down project implementation activities. The project team opted for online meetings and consultations with government counterparts to maximize on the work delivery as much as possible, although several things were not possible as the government went to emergency mode.

Establishment of the oversight mechanism also got delayed for the same reason, but after repeated negotiation and onboarding the Principal SDG Coordinator, the committee was finally approved, and is expected to be mobilized soon."
Barbados MCO,"Due to delays resulting from the events highlighted above, public sector stakeholders were either not available or difficult to reach for meetings that necessarily shifted to virtual formats. PUNO staff and consultants were not able to travel to the JP countries because of closed borders and/or internal restrictions placed on businesses.

UNDP and the Resident Coordinator’s Office experienced significant challenges scheduling high level officials for events. Due to the challenges and limitation of virtual meeting formats, UNEP, as a non-resident agency, will recruit a national coordinator for its finance sector activities to be based in Barbados. FAO is carrying out a budget revision in order to dedicate more staff time of the Lead Technical Officer based in Barbados to strengthen support to country partners and stakeholders.
"
Belarus,Only two budget lines by UNDGA categories was modified by UNFPA to accommodate situation on the ground
Benin,"As part of the implementation of PC activities in 2021, the main challenges encountered are:
- Delay in the implementation of some of the planned activities due to the COVID 19 pandemic.
- Institutional changes within the government structure and the transfer of responsibilities between the ministry in charge of finance and the ministry in charge of development have delayed the implementation of activities.
These major constraints delayed one of the project's flagship activities, namely the finalization of Benin's development financing strategy. 

"
Bhutan,"1. Stringent COVID-19 containment and preventive measures adopted by the government where a single case triggers black-out and lockdown (already 3 to 5 rounds of lockdown has taken place);

2. Since JP is implemented through NIM modality, reprioritization efforts by the government in addition to following government processes and rules in procuring services has caused significant delays. For example, government's temporary moratorium as part of re-prioritization exercise on consultants, surveys and assessments posed concerns on national ownership and also delayed implementation of JP.

3. Through joint efforts of RCO and PUNOs, most of the issues were resolved at the Steering Committee as well as the working group level such as surveys and assessments are being carried out and also hiring of both local and international consultants permitted. PUNOs can also directly hire consultants ensuring quality and time efficiency. Additionally, core governance task team (consisting of Ministry of Finance, GNH Commission and the UN) is planned to look into implementation issues and challenges and chart effective solutions. 
"
Bolivia,"As explained above, the political situation of the last two years, marked by national government authorities turnovers, generated a complex political context, which has been the greatest challenge faced by the UN System in implementing the programme’s advocacy actions with the government. Due to this situation, the programme identified or creatively came up with new partnerships and political dialogues with additional public actors in addition to those initially defined. Additionally, the pandemic made advocacy with the Ministry of Economy even more complex than the programme initially envisaged. This entity manages the difficult financial situation of the state has as its main priority the economic recovery from the pandemic. Given this scenario, the Ministry of Justice was identified as the primary governmental counterpart or focal point for the programme’s implementation for this first year."
Bosnia and Herzegovina,"The JP’s implementation encountered two major challenges. First of all, the initial delay of the formal launch of the JP reflected on the pace of implementation and financial delivery. COVID-19 pandemic additionally impacted the efforts to accelerate implementation, particularly with respect to availability of national counterparts (infected by the virus or in isolation). Consequently, these delays affected timely release of the funds earmarked for the 2nd Component and delivery of results in effective and timely manner (for UNICEF and WHO). To overcome this challenge, the UN RC initiated the procedure of exceptional transfer of a part of the second instalment with the SDG Fund, while in parallel accelerating implementation of the Component 1, as per the Acceleration Plan submitted to the SDG Fund. Although the political situation in the country has significantly deteriorated in the past months, it has not affected implementation of the JP."
Botswana,"1.        Integrated National Financing Framework
•        The staff movement/s in project personnel have contributed to delayed progress in implementation. The UNDP Economic Advisor who was the Technical Lead for the INFF was reassigned to a different country in Q1, 2021. The staff has still not been replaced. Thus, the INFF has been without the Technical Lead for over six (9) months. UNDP has assigned an officer who has facilitated progress of the componentt on the INFF. 
•        The International Consultant for undertaking the INFF Assessment and develop the INFF Roadmap terminated his contract in the inception phase of the project. This resulted in delays as the project had to procure his replacement. A replacement for the Consultant was expedited and the new Consultant is working with the national consultant in delivering the work on the INFF. To this end the draft Report on the Scoping Assessment has been submitted in December 2021 for consideration by the Technical Working Group. 

2.        Gender Responsive Budgeting
•        UNWomen which is the lead agency on the Gender component, had staff movements, including the focal for this initiative, which contributed to a delay in implementation (the focal person left the project, and it took over a month to get a replacement). UNWomen which is the lead agency on the Gender component, had staff movements, including the focal for this initiative, which contributed to a delay in implementation (the focal person left the project, and it took over a month to get a replacement). A new focal person joined the project and the work has progressed. 
•        Implementation of the gender component was also delayed by prolonged consensus building and ownership with the IP (Ministry of Nationality, Immigration and Gender). The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development as the coordinating partner facilitated engagement with the Ministry of Nationality, Immigration and Gender. The engagement led to the coming on board of the Ministry of Nationality, Immigration and Gender to take lead in implementing the gender component. 
"
Burundi,"        The first challenge which has been already documented a lot was the delay of the start of the JP because of the delayed launch done by the Steering Committee. Even if internal work has been done in the first 6 months of implementation, 2021 is really the year of implementation of the JP. 
The second challenge was the delay in the disbursement of the second tranche implying a little delay in the implementation of the activities. In order to face it, some agencies have engaged their own funding in order to move forward with the activities. Thanks to that and with the second tranche, all Agencies are implementing the remaining activities as planned.
A third one is that the TFPs are not allowed to collect statistical data on Burundian territory. As a result, some studies that were supposed to be finalized and validated in 2021 will be done in 2022. 
 "
Cambodia,"First, the JP launch and establishment of SC were delayed due to COVID-19 community outbreaks. Consequently, it created a delay in approval of workplan and budget implementation plan by SC. 

Second, because of emerging demands from the Government for policy advice and technical assistance to respond to the pandemic, the JP has adopted a discovery and demand-driven approach. The rapid support from the UN has helped to: (i) move forward the discussion and policy development for the introduction of debt instruments; (ii) enable budget optimization that has boosted health sector and social protection allocations; and (iii) provided policy advisory to help shape the government’s recovery strategy. This being achieved through the streamlining of decision making, flexible programming and rapid procurements initiated by the PUNOs.

Third, the team faced difficulties to recruit competent international/local consultants. To offset these challenges, the team mobilized internal expertise from other country offices.
"
Cameroon,"•	There were challenges organizing large training events due to restriction related to COVID-19. We resorted to small workshops and online meetings for joint validation workshop for the studies.
•	At UNDP (the lead PUNO), staff turnover has affected project implementation. Both the Senior Economist and the National Economist who were assuring the technical lead of the JP have left. The new Senior Economics arrived in August 2021.
•	Priority was given to COVID-19-related interventions. Measures were taken to continue JP Projects, given the high political support the project is garnering.
•	UN Women and the IMF are supporting the government to reform GRB, but UN Woman’s part of the support (capacity building of budget actors) is coming at the tail end after IMF’s support (development of the tools and guidelines). UNW continues to liaise closely with government and IMF to see that the project evolves smoothly up to the end."
Cape Verde,"Ministry of Finance lack of commitment: it can be due to capacity limitations, government priorities in a more challenging macroeconomic / fiscal context than expected, a lack of commitment / interest in the INFF process, or a combination of the above. When it comes to capacity, several efforts have been made to offer resources for the establishment of a technical coordination team at the MF/DNP to resolve bottlenecks and to provide consultants for issue-specific activities. 

While UNDP/JO is striving to deliver these funds in accordance with the JP document, we observe that progress is primarily taking place in the context of INFF-related activities where the MF/DNP does not play a leading role (e.g. private sector engagement). Unfortunately, an extensive reprogramming of the activities and budgets under the JP to reflect these realities appears to be inevitable if the funds are to be disbursed within the proscribed timeframe under government leadership
"
Colombia,"•	MoF played an important role in supporting the implementation of INFF. However, tighter fiscal constraints due to COVID-19 and tax revenues led the MoF to prioritize other areas. To address this issue, the JP gave inputs for the designing of the last tax reform, including financial support for a national survey.

•	There were increasing concerns about the DFA as another assessment without a real scope for implementation. The JP engaged members from the steering and technical committees to define specific topics to be addressed by the DFA that respond to the current needs of the Colombian Government.

•	The 2022 Colombian presidential election is shifting government priorities. Uncertainties about medium-term priorities are in doubt (e.g. climate goals). To mitigate this, the JP scheduled quarterly committees during 2021, adjusting INFF implementation to these new priorities. Additionally, INFF-Colombia recently established a line of work to provide inputs for the next National Development Plan 2022-2026. 

"
Comoros,"Au cours de cette première année de mise en œuvre le jp s’est heurté à plusieurs défis tel que : 
-	les conditions de mobilisation d'une mission de TIWB qui sont soumises à des procédures longues et parfois compliquées ;
-	Les mesures barrières consécutives à la Covid-19 qui ne facilitent pas la mobilisation de l’expertise internationale requise et empêchent de travailler dans des conditions optimales ;
-	En plus des défis et contraintes ci-dessus indiqués, le secteur de la santé limité en termes de ressources humaines pour la continuité des services devrait s’impliquer directement sur le terrain dans la réponse de la COVID-19 pendant les vagues qu’a connues le pays 
Pour faire face à ces défis, nous avons lancé avec l’appui technique de l’Agence Comorienne de la Coopération Internationale les procédures de négociation avec des pays partenaires (Maroc) pour la mobilisation d’un expert pour le programmes IISF.
Quant au secteur de la santé,  la seule issue était de collecter uniquement les données du niveau gouvernemental et attendre  une accalmie de la pandémie. "
Congo DR,"Key challenges faced during the programme implementation are:
-	The Change in the Government in March 2021 caused major delay in the implementation of the joint programme. From December 2020 to May 2021, almost all activities of the JP were practically stopped due to these changes. 
-	COVID 19 3rd Wave: From May 2021 and August 2021, DRC, similarly to several African countries, was hit by a severe 3rd Wave of COVID 19 causing a second lockdown and slowdown of the JP’s activities. 
-	Difficulties to recruit qualified consultants to provide technical assistance to Government: with the specificity of the work in the JP, PUNOs needed to recruit quality firms with strong experience and reputation to deliver products that can have the expected impact in the DRC. 
-	Lack of relevant data and difficulties to access financial data.
The JP has overcome the aforementioned challenges with a clear commitment from the government and the successful recruitment of consultants. "
Costa Rica,N/A
Cuba,"1.	In 2021 Cuba suffered the highest wave of Covid-19 infections. Severe mobility restrictions were imposed that limited the organization of workshops and other face-to-face activities, as well as the full execution of the expenditures plan (e.g., official travel and workshops). At present, the health situation in Cuba is more stable (more than 85% of the population is fully vaccinated and two million people have received a booster dose), which made it possible to open the economy and lift restrictions at the end of 2021.
2.	The Cuban government launched the process of monetary unification in January 2021. This process combines measures of devaluation, exchange rate unification, wage increases, reduction of subsidies and changes in price formation mechanisms, with strong impacts on relative prices, resources allocation, and national accounts, which could have significant impact on the assessment of the quantitative exercises conducted under the JP.
Both challenges have been effectively managed and have not generally undermined the achievement of the expected results. Close collaboration has been built with the government and this has made it possible to adjust the work plan activities when needed and promote discussion on how to incorporate the potential impacts of monetary unification into JP exercises.
In the next months, both challenges could persist, but perhaps at lower levels. The UN team has gained experience gained to address and mitigate their impact (close collaboration with authorities, virtual alternatives, new sources of statistics and reports).
"
Djibouti,"The Joint Programme has experienced significant delays in implementation because its intervention is aligned to the National Development Plan, which was not approved when expected. Because the NDP has only recently been approved, while we have proactively engaged consultants, accounting for the current commitment rate, it was not possible to achieve many of the planned year one results during the JP’s first year of implementation. To address this, a crucial Steering Committee, in presence of the Minister of Finances and Minister of Social affairs, has been organized in November 2021 and was an opportunity to secure the political buy-in at Minister level to accelerate the implementation of the project. The meeting of the Steering Committee was also useful in clarifying the status of the project, the priorities of the government for the Fund and strengthened communication and coordination among the and between the UN and government.

After discussions on progress and challenges in the implementation of the project, the Steering Committee provided strong backing to the acceleration plan."
Ecuador,"The government administration change causes some delays of the JP, including the validation of the programme outputs and outcomes. Notwithstanding, the continuous dialogues (held virtually), in-person meetings, and coordination between national counterparts and PUNOs technical teams achieved a satisfactory implementation of the JP throughout the year. Also, considering the reduction of fiscal expenditures, re-allocation of financial resources due to the pandemic, and the change of the government priorities; it is to be noted that the advocacy efforts led by the RCO and PUNOs representatives positioned the CCM reduction as one of the main development challenges of the country.  

Additionally, UNDP provided technical assistance to the government transition process through its regional program SIGOB and organized technical spaces to position the relevance of INFFs. Also, the PUNOs have provided technical assistance to ensure the relevance of JP actions vis a vis the governments needs and requirements.
"
Egypt,"The changes made to Egypt’s JP reflect a revised work plan to address the request for a no cost extension. This is necessary to fulfil the expected results of the programme partnership with the Government of Egypt, which expressed its willingness and commitment to collaborate and accelerate implementation. Changes also reflect the addition of the environment sector to the priority areas of the government for support.

Furthermore, the pace of delivery of activities and ability to convene multiple stakeholders was impacted by COVID restrictions, including for travel. This has been reflected in the new revised work plan to some extent, including a new timeline for implementation by PUNOs.
"
Fiji MCO,"Delays have been experienced due to the following reasons:
•	Difficulties in recruiting International Consultants and challenges with working remotely due to boarder closures;
•	Turn over of project manager within the lead PUNO;
•	Limited availability of suitable local consultants;
•	Unable to travel to countries for programming and trouble shooting challenges more efficiently;
•	Impact of COVID-19 on PUNO staff based in Fiji – given widespread infection from February 2021 to-date, meaning temporary closure of office and current work from home arrangements, but also new safety and health challenges;
•	Changes in counterparts and government personnel in some countries, including a sudden change of Finance Minister in RMI recently which will impact momentum of programmed work given leadership to-date;
•	Inability to host in-person training and capacity building events, given COVID-19 restrictions, and virtual means being utilized with mixed effectiveness and lower spending relative to plans; and
•	Governments priority focus on COVID 19 health and safety measures as well as livelihoods relief efforts and economic recovery efforts."
Gabon,"The joint program did not have any major changes in the Theory of Change, the expected results. The Action Plan and Budget were revised due to the delay in starting the joint project."
Ghana,"The JP workplan was revised to include the conduct of the biennial DCF survey which serves to monitor, review and document the evidence on the status of effectiveness of development cooperation in Ghana. The government values the DCF Survey as an opportunity for a structured reflection on national development cooperation systems, including bringing specific value through (i) contributing to design and operationalization of INFF and (ii) making financial and non-financial cooperation more adequate, predictable and targeted towards achieving the SDGs.

The JP sees the DCF Survey as an opportunity to deepen understanding of the SDG financing landscape and implementation agenda in Ghana. The survey evidence will help support the development of appropriate financing strategies and partnerships as part of the key objectives of the INFF and other financing strategies. It will also support the review of the JP’s implementation strategy across all its outputs towards accelerating the attainment of SDGs in Ghana."
Guatemala,"The Covid-19 pandemic has been a constant risk for the progress of the JP and has slowed down the expected results. Options such as virtual work were prioritized according to the institutional capacity of the public sector and in the case of face-to-face work the rules of social distancing were complied with.

The administrative procedures requested by government counterparts for implementing the JP have led to a slow start; for example, HR recruitment required several months for completion. Mitigation measures, such as compressing some deliverables, accelerating others and/or prioritizing certain products according to the public sector planning and budgeting processes have therefore been taken.

A significant challenge is the comprehensive and formal exercise to coordinate and agree on the intersectoral analysis of models and cost estimates. Contact has been made with at least 30 different directors in at least 12 different public institutions to which close and ongoing technical assistance has been provided. Obtaining and compiling information has required additional efforts, since it is dispersed and analysis was required to validate its quality, which has involved many work meetings to make progress as a team with public servants despite the Covid-19 pandemic."
Guinea,"The implementation of the JP came up against the political and health situation of the country:
•	The institutional instability following October 2020 presidential election marked by violence amongst civilian, the delay in setting up a new government, and the subsequent military coup in September 2021 slowed down the implementation of the JP, in particular its official launch and the INFF process
•	In addition, the ongoing COVID19 pandemic and the resurgence of Ebola Virus Disease also slowed down the implementation of the JP, especially for in persons workshop and in-country travel.
Solutions implemented:
•	High-level advocacy with the Government via the Ministry of Planning to position the project as a priority within the framework of the preparation of the PNDESII
•	Implementation of some activities before the official launch of the JP to reduce delay in implementation
The SNU and the Government are requesting a 6-month extension of the JP until December 31.
"
Haiti,"Haiti is experiencing turbulent times which have affected the initial implementation of the JP: (i) successive political crises, with frequent government reshuffles, peaked in July with the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse; (ii) mounting gang violence terrorising the population with kidnappings and murders and stepped-up its act with a month-long blockade of fuel distribution, bringing the country almost to a halt; (iii) in August, an earthquake imposed a new urgent agenda on the government and development partners to address the immediate needs of the population and plan for the reconstruction of the affected areas.

To overcome adversities and minimise their impact on the JP, the team initiated in July weekly virtual meetings with delegates from the Ministry of Planning, the Ministry of Finance and, on various occasions, the Central Bank. The meetings have been instrumental to ensure continued and sustained engagement by the government and increase delivery for the JP. Between October and December 2021, the JP has made considerable progress in all its activities. In December 2021, acknowledging the challenging political, security and public health conditions and the recently approved SDG Roadmap, the JP Steering Committee decided for an extension of the joint programme to align it closely to the yet to be enacted roadmap.

"
Jamaica,"The JP’s planned financial implementation rate for the calendar year was primarily impacted by the negative effects of the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic which contributed significantly to a context of radical uncertainty, and difficult trade-offs given the health, economic and social challenges. The JP’s implementation schedule was delayed by approximately 3-5 months as critical stakeholders within the Ministries of Health and Education were engaged in the country’s management, response and recovery. These stakeholders were being targeted to inform a comprehensive review of the GOJ’s Medium Term implementation of Results Budgeting, as well as to be engaged in a series of training and retooling sessions. Notwithstanding, with adjustments to the schedule and the strong network within the oversight committee, the JP was able to complete the review within the 3rd quarter and execute the training/ retooling within the 4th quarter of 2021.    "
Jordan,"The focus on addressing the impact of COVID-19 is affecting ownership on issues like climate change and gender. Government capacity particularly on steering discussions around F4D remain weak while many development partners focus on the humanitarian response. Changes in key counterparts affect the continuity of strategic policy dialogue. This is affecting scaling current activities, initiating the development of an INFF roadmap and setting up the national oversight committee. The UNCT is currently reviving the F4D working group to help scale our efforts. 
On the private sector side, there is limited awareness of the business case for aligning investments and business strategies to impact and the impact investment ecosystem is nascent. The JP and discussions during the preparatory phase of Component 2 provided some momentum and entry points. There is an urgent need to invest in follow-up to seize on this momentum so it can contribute also to the recovery agenda.
"
Kazakhstan,"•        Ensuring sufficient level of engagement and commitment of certain national partners to the JP implementation remains a key challenge. Active engagement of the MNE and its ownership over SDGs implementation helps to establish constructive dialogue with Government representatives. Conducting regular consultations with national partners explaining the JP outcomes and their potential contribution to them helps to determine mutual areas of cooperation and benefits that JP can bring to achieve their objectives.

•        Significant reforms in strategic planning at national level including integration of SDGs into national projects and strategic programs caused some of the outputs envisaged in the Annual work plan for 2021 to be postponed until final approval of documents by the Government. For instance, completion of such activities as formulation of SDG aligned climate financing strategy and development of a roadmap for implementing (gender-responsive) SDG budgeting in Kazakhstan have been shifted to the first half of the 2022. These slight changes in the timeline of certain outputs doesn’t affect JP implementation as originally the deadlines were set with an assumption that this sort of challenges might arise.

•        Low interest and commitment to the development of child budget from central and local authorities (except for MoES) / conducting an intensive communication and dialogue with national partners resulting in better alignment of the current government targets with child budget goals.

"
Kyrgyzstan,"During the reporting period, the main challenges related to JP’s implementation were related to the ongoing political changes and frequent changes of counterparts. The Decision-making process on the counterpart side was slow and some key decisions were significantly delayed, despite the JP team’s efforts and reminders. Like the establishment of the JP’s Governance structure, and identification of the respective focal points. Political changes took the priority attention of their counterparts and were associated with the change in Constitution and laws. Frequent changes of counterparts took time and efforts of the JP team to present the information and establish a working relationship with them. The JP’s design envisages full commitment and strong ownership of the INFF of the President’s Administration; thus, it was important to involve them and allow them to lead the JP implementation. These changes, which occurred three times in 2021, negatively impacted the JP implementation. "
Lao PDR,"1. COVID-19: caused delays, overcame through adaptation, additional staff hours, and the strong involvement of the RCO in strategy, coordination, trouble shooting and problem solving and stakeholder engagement, both with government and technical partners including the IFIs. The momentum gained on the INFF with the High-Level RTM, under the overall leadership of the RC, helped to catch up on progress.

2. Poor government engagement at a technical level. RCO-led mitigation measure usually consisted in securing a higher-level meeting and building relationships with specific individuals to unlock progress.

3. Political sensitivity: this was usually resolved by time dedicated by RCO to capacity building sessions, to desensitize issues, or referencing legitimate documents in the country (National Agenda on Macroeconomics, National Plan, IFIs research, etc.).

4. Data availability: this was managed by, when necessary, an update of deliverables (but importantly, not of expected outcomes), or RCO requesting request for support from other UN agencies and development partners.

5. Language: Progress is contingent on availability of Lao documents. Working closely with national staff and spending more than anticipated on translation helped to address this.
"
Lebanon,"	Over the reporting period, Lebanon has been hard hit by compounded crises that crippled normal life in the country, affecting economic, political, and social aspects. The economic and financial crisis that flared up in the fall of 2019 continued to escalate causing a severe deterioration in the country’s socio-economic conditions, and was topped up with the outbreak of the COVID19 virus and the explosion in the port of Beirut port On august 4, 2020.. These consecutive crises have been further exacerbated by an extended political deadlock following the resignation of the government in the aftermath of the blast, and the failure to form another one until very recently, with the formation of the Mikati Government in September 2021.   
	These developments created a disabling environment for the activities of the project, and limited the initiation of activities with line ministries, due to the caretaker status of the government. The economic situation has made staff less available to their ministries, and the budget preparation process was completely halted. 
	The ministry of agriculture, prior to the new government, opted to postpone any GRB work on their budgets until a new government was in place.
	Following the re-endorsement of the project document by the Ministry of Finance and the appointment of a new focal point to act as a counterpart, project activities can be resumed. 
"
Lesotho,"•	There has been limited access to resources for business continuity, including digital technologies, which has constrained engagement with partners and stakeholders, particularly with the Government of Lesotho, as a result of COVID-19. The project has provided complementary technical support and resources to enable continuous engagement. 
•	There was a substantial delay in recruitment of consultants to undertake different assignments. Calls for expression of interest had to be advertised more than twice in some instances. On all instances advertisements were posted on different platforms and extended to broader audience when re-advertising.  
•	COVID-19 Protocols prohibited physical meetings, which delayed kick-off of activities. Virtual platforms were used to hold initial meetings with the Ministry of Finance and were later followed by physical meetings once the COVID lockdown was lifted;
•	Assessment of the current MTEF and preparation for a proposed MTEF has been delayed due to Government’s 2022/23 Budget process.
"
Malawi,"The JP did not face any major challenges over the period concerned, in terms of implementation and results. However, the  production of communication materials is  lagging behind as the  bulk of the documents produced are  technical and serve the purpose of evidence-based policy making rather than awareness raising. Even products such as the Citizens Budgets focus on communicating  public finance issues rather than the project’s achievements. However, the PUNOs are planning to engage additionally in communicating the projects results to the various stakeholders, as indicated by the SDG Fund. "
Malaysia,"Three major headwinds were faced, which severely constrained activities:  (1) a seven-month State of Emergency, which limited engagement with Government and dominated policy priorities; (2) the (still) pending official endorsement of the UNSDCF and PUNOs supplementary CPAPs, imposing legal hurdles that directly curtailed agency operations; (3) two lock-down periods following waves of COVID-19, noting also, the pandemic continued to dominate Government’s and PUNOs’ agendas. 

Nevertheless, working through the AP and later revisions to the Programme Document, PUNOs were able to accelerate work, from Q2 onward through: (1) enhanced engagement with Government, and realignment of JP governance to unblock institutional/ legal constraints; and (2) innovative management, including front-loading of UN (tranche 1 and agency) funds in place of cost-shared resources; and (3) some rescheduling - the six-month extension of the JP and bringing forward deliverable work-streams. This enabled completion of three standalone outputs, and clear progress on official buy-in.
"
Maldives,"All participating agencies experienced difficulties in the past year while gaining momentum on initiatives outlined in the workplan of the JP. Almost all deliverables for the first year included diagnostics and assessments that needed to be adjusted to incorporate crisis implications for it to be timely and well informed as we build on to the operationalization phase of the INFF. PUNOs had faced difficulties in engaging with government counterparts for discussions and finalization of ToRs and for data collection and consolidation. With an upsurge of new COVID-19 cases in the city during the first half of the year, further movement restrictions and curfews were re-enacted. Despite these challenges PUNOs adapted and conducted sessions virtually including stakeholder engagements, financing dialogues of the DFA and JP high-level OC meetings and stakeholder forums with high level participation from stakeholders. "
Mali,"From the beginning of the implementation of the joint programme the national context was relatively hostile due to institutional changes and their implications at policy and operational level. The joint programme started with a six-month delay. To overcome this delay, an acceleration plan was developed by the two agencies in consultation with the national side. This plan has gradually allowed significant progress to be made, but much remains to be done to consolidate the achievements and to give the work plan a boost. The national context also presents fiduciary risks which require prudent disbursements to limit the risks. As a result, financial implementation rates may appear low, but this is the result of a deliberate effort to mitigate risks. "
Mauritania,"The main challenge is related to the health situation. In fact, COVID-19 severely disrupted Project activities, making contacts and field missions either impossible or difficult at some point. The consultation with different stakeholders were not possible to be organized directly and the project team opted for virtual meetings and consultations. 
The awareness campaign has been delayed. To deal with this, a committee made up of all the stakeholders has been set up. 
ToR’s have been prepared allowing this committee to organize a retreat to discuss and validate messages and materials to support the process in 2022. For FAO, the main challenges faced during 2021 was the hiring of international expert in the context of Covid-19 and the organization of concertation with stakeholders. "
Mexico,"The most critical aspect was the retraction of the General Attorney’s Office, the leading agency’s main counterpart. The leading agency has shifted the project implementation towards the sub-national level. Sub-national attorneys have not only agreed on the overall JP activities, but have shown the acquiescence to fast-track activities and carry out simultaneous process to accelerate implementation.

On the other hand, the administrative process to release the use of funds ran through separate routes for each PUNO. In all cases it was only after the funds had been internally released that PUNOs could start the recruitment of the JP staff, a procedure which also slowed the commencement of substantive activities. Yet, these problems were successfully resolved and have been compensated for.  

Finally, the COVID-19 restrictions forced the JP to revise its budget and re-structure some implementation strategies, mainly those related on on-site activities. "
Mongolia,"Due to COVID related restrictions, there were some challenges to organize face to face /in person meetings, workshops and consultations which were required to conduct the expenditure reviews on child and youth focused budget and expenditure review in the social sectors, result-based budgeting, baseline study with the SDG costing and prioritization, developing the national strategies, it was also challenging to obtain some budget, financial and economic data required for the review from different line ministries. PUNOs closely partnered with all relevant stakeholders to plan and overcome these challenges in order to conduct all planned activities on time. Series of online advocacy meetings were organized online with relevant stakeholders    on the importance of the planned review , which  has resulted in   obtaining access to the  required budget data and information; timely online meetings, KIIs and focus group discussions required  for the  child focused  budget review."
Morocco,"•	The analysis of the program progress should be done within the specific context during which JP’s activities were conducted. Indeed, the Covid 19 pandemic overshadowed slightly the importance of the JP for decision-makers as the whole country was involved in priority in dealing with the pandemic. Despite that difficult context the three agencies tried to adapt the actions initially planned for a more added value of the JP in the current context. 
•	Morocco also faced national elections earlier this year. The results of the election led to an almost complete ministerial turnover and installation of a new government and Prime Minister. 
•	Lack of multilingual material delays the finalization of the ToRs of analysis and studies. "
Namibia,"The COVID-19 pandemic remained the major challenge adversely affecting the implementation of the JP. Efforts by the Government and the UN to craft strategies to prevent its spread and mitigate its socio-economic impacts, inevitably diverted attention from the JP implementation. Furthermore, this being pioneering work in terms of articulating the full range of the INFF, it has been difficult to recruit experts with the relevant capacity and skills to support implementation of the INFF.

In mitigation, Government ownership and leadership has remained key, whilst, easing of the pandemic and associated restrictions, particularly during the second half of 2021, provided some impetus towards implementation. Further, the high-level official launch raised awareness of the JP to a broad range of stakeholders, thereby catalyzing support for its implementation, whilst the technical committee’s participation in various regional and global webinars on the INFF, provided inspiring and pivotal lessons in the implementation of the JP."
Nepal,"The main challenge faced was the delay in endorsement of the JP by the Government which delayed the             implementation. This was addressed through continuous follow up and advocacy by PUNOs with the Government, resulting in the endorsement of the JP by the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration.   "
Philippines,"Implementation was set back by delays in the review and approval of key documents, particularly the budget tagging exercise and COVID-19 study. The JP organised several bilateral meetings with DBM, DOF, and NEDA to coordinate the necessary approval for the documents. 

The increased COVID-19 cases in Samar consequently resulted in delayed timelines for the training of providers on delivering adolescent health services as health professionals' (target audience) responsibilities were redirected to support the LGU-led vaccination campaign, as well as provide increased support in areas heavily affected by Typhoon Rai. A CSO-service provider will be tapped to augment the service workforce of the LGU, and ensure completion of commitments.

The case for funding strategies to address adolescent pregnancies was also challenged in terms of how it can be planned and built to meet the government timelines for budget preparation and legislation. The JP shall review timelines and ensure the alignment of advocacies with key budget preparation and investment cycles."
Rwanda,"Our main counterpart, MINECOFIN, has been leading efforts to put in place short-term economic stimulus and response measures to COVID-19 impacts. As such, its priority focus has been to some degree detracted from more systemic issues in the medium-term around development finance. Rwanda’s financing landscape has seen a rapid increase in external public debt and a more constrained fiscal space, placing high pressure on realizing the 2030 Agenda with government resources. COVID-19 containment measures have continued to have a negative impact on the pace of implementation including ability to finalize analytical work; travel restrictions have hindered international consultants from supporting some activities and building more ownership among local stakeholders. We will continue to monitor the evolution of the situation and adjust our plans accordingly. 
"
Samoa MCO,"We acknowledge the delivery status of the JP remains significantly low; however, delays are due to factors outside of the PUNOs control. COVID 19 continues to impact the implementation of the programme since the beginning (July 2020), starting with nationwide State of Emergency (SOE) restrictions put in place before the JP start date. The said has diverted the focus and priorities of the three Governments in maintaining their individual SOE orders and accelerating COVID preparedness and prevention plans. Whilst there have been some flexibility or relaxation on some of the restrictions specifically on borders in the Cook Islands and Samoa by Q4, 2021, the attention on JP implementation continued to decrease as Governments focused on ensuring proper activation of precautionary and preparedness plans. Moreover, the political situation in Samoa continued to greatly impact the delivery of the JP starting with the General election in April 2021, followed by the transitioning of the new Government. This change led to the shift in government priorities, delays in the adoption of the new Fiscal budget, and the revision of the already drafted National Development Strategy under the previous Government. As of late December, these are yet to be finalized. 
These delays have resulted in a capacity strain with key Ministries due to the persisting institutional and operational challenges. In response, the PUNOs devised an acceleration plan and have continuously engaged with the three Governments to discuss and revise work plans for activities, budgets, and timelines. As part of the acceleration efforts, UNDP had loaned resources from its Regional Office (USD33,000) and Country Office TRAC Resources (USD23,400), to support the implementation of activities programmed for Year 2 given the disbursement requirements of the second tranche. The reimbursement of the loans was under the understanding that the SDG Financing resources allocated for UNDP would be received latest early Q4, 2021. 
While the PUNOs were hopeful that operational processes in the Government of Samoa would return to business as usual with the transition of the new Government, a decision was jointly made to request for a no-cost extension (from July 2022 to December 2022) and an exceptional transfer request for the second tranche to allow sufficient time and enable the timely completion of JP activities by the PUNOs. Both requests were approved by the Operational Steering Committee in early January 2022. 
"
Sierra Leone,"Initial delay in transfer of funds from UNDP to the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development for ikey activities; now working closely with UNDP Finance Specialist for the timely disbursement of year 2 funds. 

Delay in the contractor for ‘capacity building for entrepreneurs’ signing MOUs with two financial institutions for the ‘access to finance’ component; both MOUs were in December 2021. 

COVID-19 movement and gathering restrictions delayed activities that required interpersonal contact and dialogue with counterparts outside the capital city during all of 2020.  

Program coordinator was not recruited until January 2021 and there was a transition in the UNDP technical lead during mid-2021.  Government institutional arrangements for setting up of the JP Secretariat and Steering Committee took longer than anticipated. 

Some activities have not been initiated due institutional delays of partners.  NASSIT is not ready to reorienting its investment portfolio and the ongoing COVID-19 fiscal strain makes it challenging to begin some tax-related activities.  "
South Sudan,"The outbreak of the global pandemic (COVID-19) and series of new waves had serious implications on the implementation of activities as new partial-lockdown was imposed in February 2021. Express clearance had to be obtained to conduct any activity which involved gathering people for meetings, trainings, or workshops and lack of ICT infrastructure at sub-national couldn’t allow for remote facilitations. The situation caused delay of implementation of activities. For instance, the State Ministry of Finance training was delayed and led to extension of days the consultant spent in country, leading to additional fees being paid to the consultant. It has also created disruption in flight schedules to the States. However, the situation has since eased out. 

The re-configuration of 32 states into 10 states negatively impacted project implementation since there was considerable delay in re-constitution of the state governments e.g., appointment of State Governors, Ministers, Legislative Assembly Members, and other political functionaries.

Budget preparation processes experienced several bottlenecks and expenditures were authorised through Presidential Decrees. Lack of internet access in many states hampered access to the PFM dashboard. School closures and the reintegration of 32 states, hampered progress on the PETS, as it required interviews to be held at subnational levels. "
Suriname,The delays of activities can be mitigated as the country is lifting travel and mobility restrictions. The establishment of the JP’s Project Management Unit (PMU) has proven essential to the engagement and involvement of stakeholders in Suriname particularly for the non-residential PUNOs. The involvement and close working relationship established with the Ministry of Spatial Planning & Environment via the advisor (Mr. Glenn Gersie) to the Minister is an essential mechanism for facilitating engagement with government and particularly with the Ministry of Finance and Planning.
Tajikistan,"The joint programme implementation continued to be impacted by the COVID pandemic and ongoing travel restrictions and even more stringent government procedures. UN Women’s study tour to North Macedonia on best practices in GRB was cancelled. Instead, UN Women provided support to the  Centre for Sustainable Development, Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment to institutionalize GRB in the APA.

UNDP had to postpone knowledge-sharing activities among Central Asian Republics on innovative financing and INFF. An increase in the number of Covid-19 made it difficult to organize study visits. If feasible, the visits will be organized in the first half of 2022.   Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have been identified as countries having good experience in SDG budgeting and alternative financing and thus provide an opportunity for Tajikistan to learn from their experience. 
"
Timor-Leste,"Not applicable, JP was not changed."
Togo,"Implementation difficulties hampered the project for a year (between June 2020 and June 2021), and initial progress was limited. Due to institutional changes that occurred with the adoption of the new government roadmap 2020-2025, it was required to modify the project document to better align it with the roadmap, in replacement of the National Development Plan (NDP 2018-2022) initially considered.  In addition, new opportunities had been integrated in the project, particularly the priority given to the promotion of the private investment for the mobilization of resources. These changes have led to an increase in the budget, the reallocation of certain lines and the revision of the workplan for better coherence among the project’s components. These adjustments required by the Government and the delays in signing of the minutes of both the steering committee and the technical committee meetings by the national authorities (which took several months) have affected the start of priority activities such as (i) the assessment of development financing and the recruitment of the international and national expertise team (which only started in June 2021), (ii) the reactivation of the computerized aid management portal, (iii) the costing of the SDGs' targets. 
During the last three (3) months, the inter-agency team has worked continuously by multiplying consultations to speed up the project. These pleas have helped to strengthen the ownership of the Government."
Tunisia,"Due to the national context, several unsuccessful efforts were made to organize a Steering Committee meeting to review and adapt the programme to the national context during 4th Q-2021. The SC meeting is however planned for January 28th, 2022.

Governmental work has been delayed since January 2021, before President Saied’s decision on July 25 to freeze parliament and dismiss then PM Mechichi. On September 29, President Saied appointed a new Prime Minister, who presented her new government, approved by the President, on October 11. The split of our main counterpart, previously Ministry of Economy, Finance and Investment Support into two portfolios – Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economy and Planification – has also impacted our national partner’s work. Nonetheless, JP teams have remained in close conversation with national focal points.
Locally, municipal councils saw their work slowed down due to the pandemic and political instability. This has impacted and postponed to 2022 the project component dedicated to capacity enhancing at the infra-national level on budget allocations for the SDGs. UNDP can capitalize on its ongoing projects and experience with local partners to support them on the elaboration of their LDPs and ensure they’re aligned on SDGs.
Managing the COVID-19 crisis (health and socio-economic consequences) has required a lot of time for our local and national partners. The situation has stabilized since September. However, this remains a possible risk as potential new contamination waves may happen. The JP teams should remain close to national partners to reach JP results and objectives.

"
Uganda,"Second phase lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic affected the launch of the INFF and undertaking feasibility studies on Livestock Vaccines Manufacturing and Commercialization in Uganda, and Mt Elgon Tourism Infrastructure. However, this did not deter progress on the implementation which is now at the 2nd stage/ production of the PFIS. It was therefore agreed to have the launch in Q2 2022 after obtaining cabinet approval of the PFIS. In addition, procurements of consultancy firms for both feasibility studies were finalized to ensure that implementation kick starts early Q1 2022. 

The second phase lockdown of COVID-19 pandemic has also seriously affected consultations and data collection process for the PFMA 2015 assessment, limited physical meetings leaving us with only online interactions which were also affected by unstable internet connectivity and expenses in affording internet bundles. That Means much of the findings captured depended on what was captured online which limited the method of observation.

COVID-19 Lock down has also delayed a number of activities, especially those related to trainings. The project activities were not only directly affected, but also getting Government partners who for half of the year operated at half capacity. Administrative and political changes in Government also caused some delays in implementation activities like the launch of the initiative and INFF has been delayed up to date. 
"
Ukraine,"Challenges faced (and addressed) over the reporting period are, as highlighted in the preceding quarterly check-in(s), mainly attributable to delays prompted by COVID-19 and low expenditures as well as efforts required to ascertain buy-in from key institutions within the Ukrainian government. Importantly, the advancement of the INFF process has been instrumental towards establishing sound working relations and overcoming gridlocks (especially vis-à-vis Ministry of Finance), ushering progress on several key activities. Such developments reflect a general acceleration of implementation across the JP´s work programme, testified by expenditure rates that have increased substantially and approach the initially planned levels. No-cost extension of UNECE´s activity implementation into Y2 has been essential in this respect, as costs budgeted for travel and onsite event were largely unspent during Y1. "
Uruguay,"Two main factors determine the delay of the JP implementation:
The COVID-19 pandemic increases the level of uncertainty among CFO and CEOs of the companies, at the same time enabling the possibility of in-presence meetings, courses, and workshops. Fortunately, the vaccination program secured high levels of immunization. The economy is recovering on a good path and 75% of Uruguayan companies are back in revenues levels of pre-crisis. Recovering phase is in progress.
The Sustainable Finance Roundtable (SFR), one of the key activities in the SDG JP program in Uruguay was in standby mode for several months (April to December). The implementation of the SFR requires coordination with IDB which was previously working on the same agenda with the government. During the COVID crisis month, the government priorities shift towards the health front. 
"
Uzbekistan,"There were two major types of challenges faced by the JP. First, the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lock-down measures and capacity limitations in all the Government entities. The development and practical implementation of key health information systems (HIS) within the pilot project in Syrdarya region was derailed because the agency responsible for digitalization of the health sector (IT-Med) was overloaded by new and unplanned priorities of the Ministry of Health. WHO decided to mobilize new resources to support linkages between the initiatives of other development partners (USAID, KfW) in the HIS space and the Syrdarya pilot, and build sufficient capacity of IT-Med. 
Second, the challenges related to the conceptual novelty of the INFF - lack of appropriately experienced consultants due to the novelty or sensitive nature of the subject. To mitigate that, the JP has engaged several individual consultants with a right mix of international, regional and national expertise."
Vietnam,"The main challenge to implementing the JP was the Government of Viet Nam's newly introduced ODA regulation, which requires a long internal process of appraisal and approval of the JP document and its work plan. As the result on 17 May 2021 the JP document was signed by GoV with a start date of June 2021, 11¬¬ months behind the original start date. Furthermore, the implementation of the JP experienced a 2-month hard ‘lockdown’ (beginning 24th July 2021) because of the fourth wave of COVID-19 cases in Viet Nam. Nonetheless, significant progress has been made due to the application of several accelerating approaches, including (i) preparing all Terms of References necessary for implementing activities within the full two-year JP work plan, (ii) applying mixed in-person and virtual meetings/workshops; (iii) establishing “hotlines” partners to quickly share the information on implementation problems encountered and find solutions.     "
Zambia,"The main challenge during the reporting period was the COVID-19 pandemic and the restrictions that were put in place by the Government. This slowed down the OBB capacity building activities for local authorities. However, in adherence to the COVID-19 health guidelines, few trainings were undertaken. In quarter four, the restrictions were eased, and the trainings were scaled up.

There was a change of Government in August 2021 which has resulted in the re-arrangement of the structure of Government line Ministries thereby affecting the overall implementation of the JP.

The change in government also slowed down the development of the 8NDP. This was because of the new Government’s need to align the 8NDP with the manifesto of the ruling party. The alignment was completed in the fourth quarter of the reporting period and finalisation of the 8NDP is expected by end of March 2022.
